# odin-landing-page
This is the landing page project for TOP. With this project I used everything I learned with CSS and flexbox. I also used all I learned with HTML. In this landing page
I learned how to round out corners on buttons and add ASCII symbols like the copyright and others. I hope to go back to this landingpage in the future and alter it to
use as a homepage for my portfolio so I can organize all of my projects.
